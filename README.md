# Geothermal Power Extender Compatibility Pack

[繁體中文說明](./README.zh.md) | [English README](./README.md)

## Introduction:
This is a mod that improves [Geothermal Power Extenders](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3373466885)'s compatibility. Now, you can choose to build power extenders next to the geothermal generator provided by other mods. It is also allowed for power extenders to be constructed in the diagonal direction of the geothermal generator.

The main reason I developed this mod is that while working on a self-made mod - [Smaller Geothermal Generator (更小的地熱發電機)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3456671049), I found it was incompatible with [Geothermal Power Extenders](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3373466885).

Since [Geothermal Power Extenders](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3373466885) is widely used by many players, I decided to create a compatibility patch to make [Geothermal Power Extenders](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3373466885) support other geothermal generators.
